I'm a data scientist with a background in applied mathematics and machine learning. I've spent the past few years building models for environmental and sustainability challenges, working with geospatial analysis, Bayesian networks, and ecological simulations.

Now I'm transitioning to industry, where I'm eager to apply these skills to solve business problems and tackle new domains. I enjoy collaborative work and creative problem-solving with data.

When I'm not working, you'll find me hiking, traveling, cooking, or playing music.

I'm open to data science roles, collaborative projects, or connecting with others in the field!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite[subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
